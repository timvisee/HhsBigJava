/**
 * BigJava P3.21 challenge:
 * The original U.S. income tax of 1913 was quite simple. The tax was:
 * - 1 percent on the first $50,000.
 * - 2 percent on the amount over $50,000 up to $75,000.
 * - 3 percent on the amount over $75,000 up to $100,000.
 * - 4 percent on the amount over $100,000 up to $250,000.
 * - 5 percent on the amount over $250,000 up to $500,000.
 * - 6 percent on the amount over $500,000.
 * There was no separate schedule for single or married taxpayers. Write a program that computes the income tax according to this schedule.

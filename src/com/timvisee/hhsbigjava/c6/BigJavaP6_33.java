/**
 * BigJava P6.33 challenge:
 * You are given a two-dimensional array of values that give the height of a terrain at different points in a square.
 * Write a method
 * public static void floodMap(double[][] heights, double waterLevel)
 * that prints out a flood map, showing which of the points in the terrain would be flooded if the water level was
 * the given value. In the flood map, print a * for each flooded point and a space for each point that is not flooded.
 * Here is a sample map:
 *   * * * *         * *
 *   * * * * *     * * *
 *   * * * *         * *
 *   * * *         * * *
 *   * * * *     * * * *
 *   * * * * * * * * * *
 *   * *     * * *
 *   *       * * * *   *
 *                   * *
 *                 * * *
 * Then write a program that reads one hundred terrain height values and shows how the terrain gets flooded when the
 * water level increases in ten steps from the lowest point in the terrain to the highest.

/**
 * BigJava P4.30 challenge:
 * Write an application to preÂ­sell a limited number of cinema tickets. Each buyer can buy as
 * many as 4 tickets. No more than 100 tickets can be sold. Implement a program called TicketSeller that prompts the
 * user for the desired number of tickets and then displays the number of remaining tickets. Repeat until all tickets
 * have been sold, and then display the total number of buyers.

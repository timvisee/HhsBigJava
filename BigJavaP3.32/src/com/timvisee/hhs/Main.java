/**
 * BigJava P3.32 challenge:
 * When you use an automated teller machine (ATM) with your bank card, you need to use a personal identification number
 * (PIN) to access your account. If a user fails more than three times when entering the PIN, the machine will block the
 * card. Assume that the user’s PIN is “1234” and write a program that asks the user for the PIN no more than three times,
 * and does the following:
 * - If the user enters the right number, print a message saying, “Your PIN is correct”, and end the program.
 * - If the user enters a wrong number, print a message saying, “Your PIN is incorrect” and, if you have asked for the PIN
 *   less than three times, ask for it again.
 * - If the user enters a wrong number three times, print a message saying “Your bank card is blocked” and end the program.

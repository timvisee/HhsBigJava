/**
 * BigJava P3.5 challenge:
 * Write a program that reads three numbers and prints “increasing” if they are in increasing order, “decreasing” if they are in decreasing order, and “neither” otherwise. Here, “increasing” means “strictly increasing”, with each value larger than its pre decessor. The sequence 3 4 4 would not be considered increasing.
